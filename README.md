# Data-Visualization
This repository is dedicted to projects of Data Visualization, creating of graphics and dashboards.
It was made during a course at Alura, and the project is a step of my learning in Data Science. 
There are two notebooks, one following the lessons, and the other are the challenges of the classes.
An important thing is that the CSV archives are in my Google Drive, so the most of the is to read my directory in that. But all the archives are on this repository, so if you want, you can download and modify it.
